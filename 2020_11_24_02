Stairs

You are climbing a stair case and it takes A steps to reach to the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Input Format:
The first and the only argument contains an integer A, the number of steps.

Output Format:
Return an integer, representing the number of ways to reach the top.

Constrains:
1 <= A <= 36

Example :
Input 1:
A = 2 Output 1:

2 Explanation 1:

[1, 1], [2] Input 2:

A = 3 Output 2:

3 Explanation 2: 

[1 1 1], [1 2], [2 1]
