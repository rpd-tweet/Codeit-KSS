1) Inverses
Problem Description
Everyone knows about multiplication mod n, where n is a positive integer. The product of two positive integers a and b mod n is the remainder when the product is divided by n.
A number a is said to have a multiplicative inverse with respect to n if there is a positive integer x less than n so that the product of a and x mod n is 1.
The great mathematician Euler proved that every positive integers less than n that is prime to n (has no common factor with n other than 1) has a multiplicative inverse with respect to n.
This problem is to find the number of positive integers less than n that have a multiplicative inverse with respect to n
Constraints
N < 10^9
Input Format
The only line of the input is a single integer N which is divisible by no prime number larger than 13.
Output
One line containing an integer that gives the number of integers less than N that have a multiplicative inverse

Explanation
Example 1
Input
20
Output
8
Explanation
N=20
If we list the numbers less than 20 which have no common factor with 20 other than 1,they are
1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19
As there are 8 of them, there are 8 numbers less than 20 which have a multiplicative inverse with respect to 20. Hence the result is 8.
Example 2
Input
36
Output
12
Explanation
N=36. There are 12 numbers less than 36 that have no common factor other than 1 with 36. These are
1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35
Hence, as proved by Euler, there are 12 numbers less than 36 that have a multiplicative inverse with respect to 36. Hence the output is 12.
